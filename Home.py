This application provides a suite of tools for financial analysis, model training, backtesting, and trade management.
Use the sidebar to navigate between the different tools.

### Available Tools:

*   **Data Management:** Control the data pipeline, from downloading market data to running rule-based scanners.
*   **Market Scanner:** Scan the market for trading signals based on pre-trained models or run an interactive scan on-demand.
*   **Model Training & Tuning:** Fine-tune strategy parameters using Bayesian optimization and train your final models with walk-forward analysis, and visualize the tuned model's out-of-sample performance, trade executions, and feature importances.
*   **Portfolio Analysis:** Discover which stocks are suitable for a strategy and run portfolio-level backtests to validate your ideas.
*   **Interactive Backtester:** Visualize the in-sample performance of a saved model on historical data.
*   **Portfolio Manager:** Manually add, view, and manage your open trading positions.
*   **Stock Report:** Generate a comprehensive fundamental and technical analysis report or CANSLIM analysis for any stock.
*   **News Intelligence:** Scans recent news, generates a detailed market briefing, and analyzes it against economic risk profiles to identify potential market-moving "red flags." 

### Getting Started

1.  **Populate Data:** On the first run, baseline data for the **SPY** ticker is loaded automatically. To add more data, go to the **Data Management** page and run a "Full Download".
2.  **Scan for Signals:** Use the **Market Scanner** to find live trading signals based on pre-built rules or your own trained models.
3.  **Tune & Train:** To build custom models, navigate to the **Model Training & Tuning** page. First, "Tune Strategy" for a specific ticker to find optimal parameters, then "Train Model" to create and save the final model artifacts.
4.  **Analyze & Backtest:** Use the **Portfolio Analysis** page to discover which stocks are suitable for a strategy and run portfolio-level backtests to validate your ideas.
5.  **Deep Research:** Use the **Stock Report** page to generate a comprehensive report for a specific stock.
6.  **Explore:** Select any tool from the sidebar to continue your analysis.
